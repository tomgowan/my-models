# Python Modules
"nclcmaps.py" may be of interest to many people. It allows you to easily use most NCL colormaps in Python. I also implemented  "shiftedcolormap.py" into it, which allows you to set where your diverging colormap diverges (useful for when zero doesn't fall in the middle of your plotting range).
