# Python Modules
"nclcmaps.py" may be of particular interest to many people. I allows you to easily use most NCL colormaps in Python. I also implemented the "shiftedcolormap.py" module into it, which allows you to set where your diverging colormap diverges (useful for when zero doesn't fall in the middle of your plotting range).
